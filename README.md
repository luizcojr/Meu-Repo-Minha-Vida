# Meu-Repo-Minha-Vida

##Deixar um pouco de minha hist√≥ria aqui...

<p>Hi Folks!</p>
<p>My name is Luiz Jr, or just "Luiz/Louis".</p>

<p>I currently work as a DevOps Analyst supporting CI/CD, assisting development squads in a Banking Institution. I deal with people every day and I really enjoy interacting with them and facing new challenges, where I try to adapt as much as possible.</p>

<p>Opensource CI/CD tools and systems: </p>

- Linux Operational Systems;
- Git;
- Jenkins;
- Nexus;
- Sonarqube;
- Stack ELK.

<p>Proprietary System:</p>

- IBM Urbancode Deploy. 


<p>I like to teach and create documentation whenever possible. I have experience with Scrum techniques, and I managed to get my certification as a Scrum Master.</p>

<p>I intend to get more soon, because I believe we should always keep learning.</p>

<p>I'm studying best practices with Cloud (AWS, OCI and Azure) and containerization through Docker and Kubernetes, and Ansible scripts. </p>

<p>In addition I am doing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, as a way to improve my programming skills.</p>
